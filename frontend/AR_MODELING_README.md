## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Performance Notes

- Optimized for 60fps rendering
- Efficient memory management
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Hardware acceleration enabled

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to `/ar-modeling` in your application
2. The interface will load with a default cube model
3. Use the controls to customize your 3D model
4. Save your work using the "Save & Exit" button

## Troubleshooting

- **Model not loading**: Check browser console for errors
- **Performance issues**: Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled
- **Controls not responding**: Verify mouse/touch input is working
- **Save not working**: Check localStorage permissions in browser
